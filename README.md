# Creating-a-Knowledge-Graph-from-Text

**Overview:**
In this project, we will delve into the fascinating realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a knowledge graph from text data. A knowledge graph serves as a powerful tool for organizing and representing information in a structured and interconnected manner, facilitating efficient retrieval and analysis.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Preprocess text data by identifying patterns and resolving coreferences.
- Utilize spaCy for named entity recognition and text preprocessing tasks.
- Construct a knowledge graph using the NetworkX library.
- Visualize the knowledge graph using Matplotlib and the pyvis library.

**Skills Required:**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Text Preprocessing
- Knowledge Graphs

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of text preprocessing techniques.
- Familiarity with NLP concepts such as named entity recognition.
- Understanding of graphs and graph-based data structures.

**Technologies Used:**
- spaCy
- Python
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib
- pyvis

**Project Description:**
A knowledge graph serves as a structured representation of knowledge, consisting of interconnected entities and their relationships. In this project, we will leverage text data obtained from The Wikipedia Library and process it using spaCy, an open-source NLP library. The text will undergo preprocessing steps, including pattern identification, coreference resolution, and named entity recognition.

Subsequently, we will transform the processed text into a knowledge graph, extracting subject-predicate-object triples to establish relationships between entities. The NetworkX library will be instrumental in constructing the graph, providing functionalities for graph manipulation and analysis. Additionally, we will employ Matplotlib for visualization purposes, enabling us to visualize the constructed knowledge graph.

The resulting knowledge graph will not only serve as a compact representation of information but also facilitate information extraction through simple queries. By integrating text processing capabilities with graph-based representations, this project will offer insights into the creation and utilization of knowledge graphs from textual data.

**Getting Started:**
1. Install Python and the required libraries (spaCy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, pyvis).
2. Clone the repository containing the project files.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the documentation to preprocess text data and construct the knowledge graph.

**Acknowledgments:**
We extend our gratitude to the developers of spaCy, NetworkX, Matplotlib, and pyvis for providing the foundational tools and libraries that enable us to create and visualize knowledge graphs from text data.

**Disclaimer:**
This project is for educational purposes and should be used responsibly. The accuracy and completeness of the knowledge graph may vary depending on the quality of the input text data and the preprocessing techniques employed.
